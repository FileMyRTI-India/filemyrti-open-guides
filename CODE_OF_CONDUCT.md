# FileMyRTI Community Code of Conduct

Our goal is to make RTI knowledge simple, trustworthy, and accessible to everyone.  
We’re a documentation-first, citizen-centric project. Courtesy and clarity matter.

This Code applies to all spaces in this project (issues, discussions, pull requests,
docs, meetings, and social channels linked from the repo).

## Our Values
- **Respect**: Assume good intent. Critique ideas, not people.  
- **Helpfulness**: Welcome beginners. Explain what/why, not just “no”.  
- **Accuracy**: Prefer verifiable sources, official links, and plain language.  
- **Privacy & Safety**: Never post private data (addresses, phone numbers, case IDs).  
- **Neutrality**: No political campaigning, hate speech, or personal attacks.

## Expected Behavior
- Be kind and inclusive; use gender-neutral language where possible.  
- Back claims with sources (official circulars, Acts, FAQs, government sites).  
- Keep PRs focused and reversible; summarize changes in the description.  
- Mark opinions clearly; avoid legal advice phrasing (“you must/should sue…”).  
- If you disagree, propose an alternative with a reference or example.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, insults, or discriminatory jokes/language.  
- Doxxing or sharing personally identifiable or case-sensitive information.  
- Sexualized language or unwelcome advances.  
- Spam, astroturfing, or undisclosed promotion.  
- Knowingly sharing false or plagiarized content.  
- AI-generated text pasted without human review and sources.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, email **admin@filemyrti.com**
with links/screenshots. We will acknowledge within 5 business days and keep reports
confidential to project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may edit/remove content, request changes, issue warnings, or restrict
participation (temporary or permanent) when the Code is violated. Severe or repeated
violations may be escalated to GitHub Trust & Safety.

## Attribution
This Code is inspired by the spirit of the Contributor Covenant (v2.1)
and the TODO Group Open Code of Conduct.
