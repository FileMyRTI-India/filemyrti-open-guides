# RTI Act Simplified (2025 Citizen’s Handbook)

> Plain-language guide to the Right to Information Act, 2005 (India).  
> Educational material, not legal advice.

## 1) What is RTI?
The RTI Act, 2005 empowers **any Indian citizen** to request information from **Public Authorities** (Central/State governments, departments, PSUs, municipalities, universities, etc.). The Public Information Officer (PIO) must reply within statutory timelines.

## 2) Who can file?
- Any **Indian citizen** (no age limit).  
- NRIs who are Indian citizens can file.  
- You **do not** need to give reasons for seeking information (Sec. 6(2)).

## 3) Where can you file?
- **Central Govt:** RTI Online portal or by post to the Ministry/Dept PIO.  
- **State Govt:** State RTI portal (where available) or by post to the Dept PIO.  
- **Local bodies/Universities/PSUs:** write to their **PIO**.

## 4) What information can you ask for?
Ask for **existing records**: files, orders, circulars, note sheets, certified extracts, registers, inspection records, file-movement, dates, actions taken, names/designations of officers, and applicable rules.

> ✅ Tip: Write “**Please provide certified copies of…**” instead of asking “why” or opinions.

## 5) What **cannot** be disclosed? (key exemptions)
Under **Section 8(1)**, info may be refused if it relates to:  
- Security/strategic interests/foreign relations  
- Court-barred disclosures  
- Trade secrets/commercial confidence  
- Fiduciary information (unless larger public interest)  
- Info from foreign government in confidence  
- Life/physical safety or identifying sources  
- Ongoing investigation/arrest/prosecution  
- Cabinet papers while under consideration  
- Personal information without public interest

Other limits: **Sec 9** (copyright on third-party work), **Sec 11** (third-party procedure), **Sec 7(9)** (not in a form that disproportionately diverts resources).

> 🔓 **Public-interest override:** Many 8(1) exemptions can be overridden if larger public interest justifies disclosure.

## 6) Fees (general)
- Application fee usually **₹10** (varies by state rules).  
- Copy/print/inspection charges extra as per rules.  
- BPL exemptions may apply with proof.

## 7) Timelines
- **30 days** from receipt by PIO (Sec. 7(1)).  
- **48 hours** if it concerns **life or liberty**.  
- Add **+5 days** if filed via APIO.  
- **First Appeal:** within **30 days** of PIO reply/non-reply.  
- **Second Appeal:** within **90 days** to CIC/SIC after First Appeal order or lapse.

## 8) How to write a strong RTI
- Identify the **Public Authority/PIO** correctly.  
- Use sections: *Subject, Background (1–2 lines), Information Sought (numbered).*  
- Ask for **documents/records** with date ranges & file numbers; seek **certified copies**.  
- Ask for **file-movement** (who handled, dates, actions).  
- Mention fee mode and request intimation of additional charges.  
- Provide preferred mode of receipt (email/post) and contact details.  
- Add **citizenship declaration** and signature.

## 9) Appeals & Complaints
- **First Appeal (Sec. 19(1))** → to **FAA** within 30 days (delay, deemed refusal, unsatisfactory reply).  
- **Second Appeal (Sec. 19(3))** → to **CIC/SIC** within 90 days.  
- **Complaint (Sec. 18)** → to CIC/SIC for issues like no PIO appointed/refusal to accept RTI.

## 10) Model “Information Sought” points (examples)
- “Certified copy of the **note sheet**, correspondence, and orders on file no. ______ from __/__/____ to __/__/____.”  
- “**File-movement/diary** entries: names/designations of officers, dates of receipt/forwarding, and actions taken.”  
- “Certified copy of the **rules/GR/circular** governing ______ as on date.”  
- “Current **status** of application no. ______ with dates and officer names handling it.”

## 11) Do / Don’t
**Do:** be specific, ask for records, give date windows, keep a polite formal tone.  
**Don’t:** ask “why”/opinions, seek creation of new data, or ask beyond the authority’s domain.
